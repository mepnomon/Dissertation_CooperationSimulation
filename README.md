The software contained in this repo is not intended for end users.


For this software to be of any use, an understanding of the Java Programming Language as well as an awareness of the 
theoretical foundation of Network Science, with a focus on the study of the emergence of the phenomenon of cooperation, 
are required. Key research can be found in dissertation's references.

The software package, as is, provides the following functions:

1. A utility library enabling users to quickly construct and evaluate desired scenarios.

2. A Node object, designed to mimmick various cognitive abilities of real life organisms, to varying degrees, as well as the ability to use different game theoretical models to simulate interactions.

3. Several pre-configured game-models and the ability to change parameters. Parameters can be changed in ExpConstants.java.

Moreover,the package contains some collected sample-data (but not all), as well as the reserach paper itself.
